In the server-side rendering approach, JavaScript code is compiled in the server, not in the browser. As a result, simple and meaningful HTML is created immediately in the browser.

Vue components generate and manipulate DOM in the browser by default. The same components can alternatively be rendered in HTML on the server, sent directly to the browser, and then “hydrated” into a fully interactive app on the client. A server-rendered VueJS project can also be deemed isomorphic (rendering pages on both the server and client-side).

**Faster page loads**

what is an http request
An HTTP request is made by a client, to a named host, which is located on a server. The aim of the request is to access a resource on the server.

http used to fetch hypertext documents,  also images and videos or to post content to servers, like with HTML form results. HTTP can also be used to fetch parts of documents to update Web pages on demand.

what is the http protocol?

**HTTP**
 is a [protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol) for fetching resources such as HTML documents.
  It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a 
client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the 
recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout description, images, videos, 
scripts, and more.
