Components can be reused as many times as you want or used in another component, making it a child component.Data, computed, watch, and methods can  be used in a Vue component.

what is props

“Props” is a special keyword which stands for properties. It can be registered on a component to pass data from a parent component to one of its children components.

Data in props can only flow one way – from the top, or parent component, to the bottom, or child components. This simply means you cannot pass data from a child to a parent.
